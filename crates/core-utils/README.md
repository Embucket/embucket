# core-utils

Provides common utility functions, data structures (e.g., for iteration), error handling, and abstractions used across multiple `core-*` and `api-*` crates, facilitating interactions with storage and data processing.

## Purpose

This crate contains shared helper code, custom error types, and common traits to reduce duplication and promote consistency across the Embucket codebase.
