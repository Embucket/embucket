# api-ui-static-assets

Bundles and provides access to static web assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) for the Embucket UI. These assets are embedded into the application at compile time.

## Purpose

This crate includes the compiled frontend assets (e.g., from a JavaScript framework build) as a Rust library, allowing them to be served efficiently by the `api-ui` crate.
