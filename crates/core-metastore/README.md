# core-metastore

Core library responsible for the abstraction and interaction with the underlying metadata storage system. Defines data models and traits for metastore operations.

## Purpose

This crate provides a consistent way for other Embucket components to access and manipulate metadata about catalogs, schemas, tables, and other entities, abstracting the specific storage backend.
