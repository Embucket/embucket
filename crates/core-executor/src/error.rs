// ExecutionError enum and ExecutionResult type alias have been moved to core-traits crate.

// The original content of this file has been removed as it's now in core-traits.
// This file can be removed if no other error types specific to core-executor are added later.
// For now, leaving it empty.
// Note: The original file had many dependencies (DataFusionError, CatalogError, IcebergError, etc.)
// These are now expected to be handled by core-traits or the code using ExecutionError from core-traits.
