Embucket delivers a Snowflake-compatible lakehouse. This document explains how Embucket's components work together to provide a complete analytics platform in a single binary.

You'll learn about the system's architecture, core components, data flow, and operational characteristics. This overview targets data engineers, platform architects, and anyone deploying Embucket in production.


## Core components

Embucket integrates four key components into a single binary that delivers complete lakehouse capabilities.

### Query engine

[Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) powers Embucket's SQL execution. DataFusion provides:

- **Vectorized processing**: Columnar data processing using Apache Arrow
- **SQL compliance**: ANSI SQL support with Snowflake-specific extensions
- **Extensibility**: Custom functions and data source integrations

Each Embucket node runs a complete query engine, enabling horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.

<Aside type="note">
  Each Embucket node can process queries independently. This design eliminates coordinator
  bottlenecks and provides natural fault tolerance.

### Data storage

[Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) manages table metadata and provides ACID guarantees:

- **Schema evolution**: Add, drop, and change columns without rewriting data
- **Time travel**: Query historical table snapshots
- **ACID transactions**: Atomic commits with snapshot isolation
- **Partition pruning**: Efficient query performance on large datasets

All table data stays in your object storage using Parquet files organized by Iceberg's metadata structure.

### API compatibility

Embucket implements Snowflake's SQL dialect and REST API:

- **SQL compatibility**: Snowflake-flavored SQL with existing queries
- **REST API**: v1 Snowflake REST API for driver compatibility
- **Tool integration**: Works with dbt, Apache Superset, and BI tools
- **Protocol support**: All native drivers built on top of REST API

### ACID guarantees

Embucket provides ACID properties through Iceberg's snapshot isolation:

- **Atomicity**: All changes within a transaction succeed or fail together
- **Consistency**: Schema validation ensures data integrity
- **Isolation**: Concurrent queries see consistent snapshots
- **Durability**: Committed changes persist in object storage

## Deployment patterns

Embucket's stateless architecture supports several deployment patterns depending on your requirements.

### Single node deployment

Deploy one Embucket instance for development or small workloads:

- Simple setup with minimal resource requirements
- Suitable for development and testing environments
- Single point of failure during maintenance

### AWS Lambda deployment

Deploy Embucket as an AWS Lambda function:

- High availability and fault tolerance
- Horizontal scaling for increased query throughput

<Aside type="caution">
  Embucket nodes share no state, making horizontal scaling straightforward. Ensure your object
  storage and external catalog can handle concurrent access from many nodes.
