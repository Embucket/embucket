Embucket provides Snowflake-compatible analytics without vendor lock-in. Snowflake-compatible means Embucket implements the same SQL grammar and REST API semantics as Snowflake, enabling seamless migration of existing tools and workflows. You deploy a single binary that delivers familiar Snowflake SQL and REST API while keeping your data in open Apache Iceberg format.

This document introduces Embucket's core concepts, architecture, and key features. It doesn't cover installation, configuration, or usage examples.

## About Embucket

Embucket provides a Snowflake-compatible OLAP lakehouse platform. An OLAP lakehouse combines the performance of traditional data warehouses with the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of data lakes using open formats.

Embucket provides the SQL interface and tooling ecosystem you already know from Snowflake. You build on an open lakehouse architecture instead of proprietary systems. Think of it as your "Snowflake bring-your-own-cloud option." You get the same familiar developer experience. Your data stays in open formats. You maintain complete control over your infrastructure.

Embucket serves **data engineers, database operators, and data analysts**. The platform eliminates traditional data platform complexity through two key innovations. First, you deploy a statically linked single binary for effortless deployment. Second, you use a zero-disk architectureâ€”a design where nodes store no data locally and instead rely entirely on object storage for both data and metadata storage.

## Why Embucket?

Modern data teams face an impossible choice. You can accept vendor lock-in with managed cloud warehouses. Instead, you can embrace the operational complexity of building your own lakehouse stack. Embucket solves this dilemma by focusing on three core principles:

**Radical simplicity:** embucket's single binary architecture eliminates complex, dependency-heavy data stacks. You move from download to query in minutes. Data teams need no external databases, no cluster management, no operational overhead. This statically linked binary contains everything required. The zero-disk architecture uses only object storage for both data and metadata.

**Fanatical Snowflake compatibility:** data teams leverage the ecosystem of tools built for Snowflake without any vendor lock-in. You connect existing BI tools, dbt transformations, and data science workflows to Embucket with zero configuration changes. The platform accepts the exact SQL you already use. Embucket implements Snowflake's SQL grammar and REST semantics to ensure seamless compatibility.

**Open source foundation:** embucket builds on proven, best-in-class open source technologies you can trust. The platform leverages [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) for lightning-fast query execution, [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) for ACID transactions and schema evolution, and [SlateDB](https://slatedb.io/) for metadata management. This avoids proprietary black boxes. Embucket serves as a well-integrated component in the modern open source data stack, with active contributions back to these upstream projects.

The platform provides the interface you already know from Snowflake. Your data stays in open formats. Compute costs remain under your control.

## Key features

### Stateless compute

Stateless compute means servers keep no local state between queries or sessions. Object storage and the Iceberg catalog handle durability and metadata. This architecture makes upgrades, scaling, and failover trivial.

### Query-per-node architecture

Query-per-node architecture means each node can independently process complete queries without requiring a separate coordinator layer. Each node serves as both coordinator and executor. This design eliminates single points of failure. The architecture provides better fault tolerance and simpler scaling. You add or remove nodes elastically to handle load spikes.

### Snowflake-first compatibility

Embucket implements Snowflake's SQL grammar and REST semantics instead of inventing a new dialect. You reuse existing drivers, SDK, and workflows with minimal changes.

### Apache 2.0 license

Embucket operates under the Apache 2.0 license as open source software.

## Summary

Embucket delivers Snowflake-compatible analytics through a single binary deployment. Data teams get familiar SQL interfaces without vendor lock-in. The platform uses open formats like Apache Iceberg for data storage. The zero-disk, stateless architecture simplifies operations while maintaining high performance and reliability.
