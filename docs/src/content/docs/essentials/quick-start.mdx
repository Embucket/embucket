This guide shows you how to start Embucket and run your first query in under 5 minutes. You use Embucket's single-binary architecture to start running queries.

Read this guide to:

- Start Embucket with zero external dependencies
- Connect with the Snowflake command-line tool
- Run your first query

This guide doesn't cover production deployment or advanced configuration options.

## Step 1: Start Embucket

Start the Embucket server:

```bash
docker run --name embucket --rm -p 3000:3000 embucket/embucket ./embucketd
```

**Done.** You need no external dependencies, databases, or complex configuration.

Embucket displays output like:

```
{"timestamp":"2025-07-01T15:35:05.687807Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000"},"target":"embucketd"}
```

<Aside type="caution">

The default Docker configuration uses no metastore configuration. See the [configuration guide](/essentials/configuration) for production options.

## Step 2: Configure the Snowflake command-line tool

Install and configure the Snowflake command-line tool against the local endpoint:

```bash
$ pip install snowflake-cli
# Find the Snowflake command-line tool config file path
$ snow --info | grep "config_file_path" -A 1
CONFIG=<your_config_file_path>
cat <<'EOF' >> $CONFIG
[connections.local]
host = "localhost"
region = "us-east-2"
port = 3000
protocol = "http"
database = "embucket"
schema = "public"
warehouse = "em.wh"
password = "embucket"
account = "acc.local"
user = "embucket"
EOF
$ snow connection test -c local
```

Expected output:

```
+-----------------------------+
| key             | value     |
|-----------------+-----------|
| Connection name | local     |
| Status          | OK        |
| Host            | localhost |
| Account         | acc       |
| User            | embucket  |
| Role            | not set   |
| Database        | embucket  |
| Warehouse       | em.wh     |
+-----------------------------+
```

## Step 3: Run your first query

Use the Snowflake command-line tool to run a query against the local Embucket instance:

```bash
$ snow sql -c local -q "select dateadd(day, -1, current_timestamp()) as yesterday;"
```

Expected output:

```
+----------------------------------+
| yesterday                        |
|----------------------------------|
| 2025-01-02 03:04:05.040000+00:00 |
+----------------------------------+
```

Open the browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to explore Embucket's web interface, query editor, and data catalog. The interface resembles Snowflake's interface.

<Aside type="tip">Use `embucket` as both the username and password to log in.</Aside>
