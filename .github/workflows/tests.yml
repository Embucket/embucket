# This is the main CI workflow that runs the test suite on all pushes to main and all pull requests.
# It runs the following jobs:
# - required: runs the test suite on ubuntu with stable and beta rust toolchains
# - minimal: runs the test suite with the minimal versions of the dependencies that satisfy the
#   requirements of this crate, and its dependencies
# - os-check: runs the test suite on mac and windows
# - coverage: runs the test suite and collects coverage information
# See check.yml for information about how the concurrency cancellation and workflow triggering works
